## LDLrui USB-C Hub Case
The [LDLrui case](https://github.com/Frosty704/mods-eyetrackvr/blob/main/LDLrui%20case.stl) is a small carriage with a cutout for the wire for [this USB hub.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NDQGSPR) It snaps into the case securely so no adhesive needed! 

It's the recommended one for ETVR because it supposedly has an MTT chip. Recommended use case is to stick it to the bridge of MUTE's facial tracker bridge with double sided adhesive/hotglue/superglue or anything similar.

<sup>mine still had the ir filters on unfortunately, so do keep in mind sometimes ali ships them with them on and you should be prepared to remove them. Luckily the lens cap was loose on this one so it wasn't hard.</sup>
