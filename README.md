## LDLrui USB-C Hub Case
The [LDLrui case](https://github.com/Frosty704/mods-eyetrackvr/blob/main/LDLrui%20case.stl) is a small carriage with a cutout for the wire for [this USB hub.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NDQGSPR) It snaps into the case securely so no adhesive needed! 

It's the recommended one for ETVR because it supposedly has an MTT chip. Recommended use case is to stick it to the bridge of MUTE's facial tracker bridge with double sided adhesive/hotglue/superglue or anything similar.

Remember to route the cable through the hole first (you may need to push it through a little, tight fit) before snapping the hub in.

## Modified MUTE DEVFrunk 
[**ALL CREDITS GO TO MUTEtheCyberwolf for the original frunk**](https://github.com/MUTEtheCyberwolf/VALVE-INDEX-DEV-Frunk-1.0)

I have slightly modified MUTE's dev frunk by adding small cutouts at the top, allowing for 0.5mm ribbon cables, and a slightly bigger hole for the [V4 LED Kit](https://store.eyetrackvr.dev/products/v4-mini-fully-solderless-kit) power cables

This works best for if you are routing the connectors through the index itself via the gaps at the top or sides. Check out [Physics-Dude's repo](https://github.com/Physics-Dude/Phys-Index-EyetrackVR-HW#cable-routing) for a little more information on the cable routing

This makes for a cleaner setup with no exposed connectors, without any soldering! 

Remember to route the cables through prior to screwing on the XIAO mount. you can find it in [MUTE's repo](https://github.com/MUTEtheCyberwolf/VALVE-INDEX-DEV-Frunk-1.0)

mine still had the ir filters on unfortunately, so do keep in mind sometimes ali ships them with them on and you should be prepared to remove them. Luckily the lens cap was loose on this one so it wasn't hard. 

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYH-FWvDbDc) is a tutorial on how to do that

## Short USB-C Cables
[0.05m Male to Male Up](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804171454889.html) 

super short usb c cables you can buy! i got the angled end but any male endings of your choosing should work fine

USB Hub im using is the [LDLrui 4 port usb c hub](https://www.amazon.com/LDLrui-4-Port-Splitter-Multiport-Adapter/dp/B09NDQGSPR)

they're a bit expensive for what they are, but the cleanliness makes it worth it i think
